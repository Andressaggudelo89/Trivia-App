# Trivia-App
The idea of this project is to learn about Android Navigation among different views.
This project will contain **one** activity only, and all the other views will be fragments.
For the navigation among views (fragments), I'll be using the **Navigation Component** (Android Studio >= 3.3).

## Steps to navigate using Navigation Component:
- Add Navigation dependencies (both Gradle files)
- Add the Navigation Graph to resources dir
- Add `NavHostFragment` to Activity layout
- Add fragments to Navigation Graph
- Connect fragments in the graph with `Actions`
- Create `onClickListener` (the one that belongs to Navigation Component)
- Navigate with our Action
